# HW4: Written Assignment

+ Due: Friday, October 22nd, 11:59pm PST
+ You will submit this homework through Blackboard, by uploading your answers.  Please submit with a common file extension (such as .jpg, or .pdf)
+ For all your answers, you will primarily be graded on **your work**.  Only putting a final numerical answer will yield very little credit.  Instead, give the formula you used, and explain your answers.  You do **not** need to provide a final numerical answer for any of these problems, but it might help your graders out a bit if you do.

### Problem 1 (Counting, 25%)

1. The UCLA computer science department creates a survey to learn how many incoming first-year students have already programmed in specific languages. The first question asks students if they have ever written a program in Java. To this question, 18 students reply yes. The second question asks students if they have ever written a program in Python. To this question, 12 students reply yes. The third question ask students if they have written a program in C/C++. To this question, 10 students reply yes. From the collected data, the UCLA department claims that 40 students have programmed in Java, C++, or Python. Why is this claim false (other than the fact that UCLA made it, so it must be false), and what is the minimum and maximum possible number of students who have programmed in Java, C++, or Python?
2. How many strings can be formed of length 5, made by using 5 of the letters in ALGORITHMS?
3. How many strings can be formed of length 10, consisting of A's, B's, and C's, but containing no more than 1 A, and containing at least 1 B?
4. A monkey is typing at a computer using only the 26 lower-case English letters.   It presses keys uniformly at random.  The monkey types 20 letters at a time. A research assistant working with the monkey wants to decipher if there is any meaning by partitioning the 20 typed letters into 3 segments (each segment consists of some number of consecutive letters). How many segments will the research assistant need to study, i.e. how many ways can the research assistant partition the 20 letters into 3 segments, where each segment contains at least 1 letter?
5. The research assistant realizes that 3 segments is quite arbitrary. How many ways can the research assistant partition the 20 letters into non-empty segments to study all the possible sets of segments?

### Problem 2 (Probability, 25%)

1. An elevator starts with 7 passengers and can make stops at 10 floors.  Each passenger will get off the elevator independently of each other and are equally likely to get off the elevator at any floor.  What is the probability that no two passengers get off the elevator at the same floor?
2. A family has 4 children, where each child is equally likely to be a boy or a girl.  E is the event where, if the children are lined up in increasing order of age, then at least two consecutive children are girls.  F is the event where the youngest child is a girl.  Are these events independent?
3. Urn 1 contains 3 red balls and 5 white balls and urn 2 contains 7 red balls and 9 white balls. We select urn 1 with probability 1/3 and urn 2 with probability 2/3.  A ball is then chosen from the selected urn, uniformly at random.  We draw a red ball: what is the probability that it came from urn 1?
4. There are n pieces of mail in a communal box for an apartment building. Tina Trojan has a letter in that box. Tina will take one letter from the box at a time, until she finds the one addressed to her.  Once she finds her letter, she will return the other letters to the box.  What is the expected number of letters Tina will draw?
5. There are 2n people that enter a housing lottery to win a free mobile service for one year.  The 2n people consist of n pairs of roommates. There are m people that win the year of mobile service, the others win nothing.  What is the expected number of pairs of roommates where neither win anything?
